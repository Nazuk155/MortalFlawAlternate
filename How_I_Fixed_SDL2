I fixed this error:

Error at CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindSDL2m.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "SDL2m", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "SDL2m" with any of
  the following names:

    SDL2mConfig.cmake
    sdl2m-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "SDL2m" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "SDL2m_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "SDL2m"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.


-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

[Finished]

By downloading the # SDL2 CMake modules fix from this Repository:

Documentation provided on git and in the README inside the cmake folder.
